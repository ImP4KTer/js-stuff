<!-- TODO:
 Create a simple TODO list with the following functions (as presented in the png from img/how-it-should-look-like.png):

1.	Add new item:
    a.	you can add a new item to the list by entering the item in the text box and pressing “Enter”
    b.	the item will appear on top of the list from the left (“TODO”)
2.	Mark an existing item as “done”
    a.	you can mark an existing item as “done” by ticking the checkbox displayed next to it
    b.	after a checkbox has been ticked, the item will be automatically moved to the list from the right side (“Already done”) – thus, it will be removed from the left-side list
3.	Mark all as “done”
    a.	after you click on “mark all as complete”, all the items from the TODO list will be moved to the “Already done” list
4.	Remove (delete) an existing item
    a.	you can remove existing items from the list in the right-side (Already done)
    b.	after you click on the “remove” icon, the item will be removed from the list
5.	For each of the two lists (TODO and Already DONE), there is a bottom (footer) yellow-ish line which will contain the number of items from each list (xx items left / yy items done). This counter should be updated automatically each time a new TODO item is added / marked as “done” / removed


Bonus points:
    a.	implement edit functionality (if you double-click an item from the TODO list, you should be able to edit that item = rename it)
    b.	research javascript localStorage and see how you can save the state of the list so it's the same after a page refresh
